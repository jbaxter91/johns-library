        // In this script we will create our first "book object"
        // I will start you off with an empty book object and some comments on the variables it needs

        var book_1 =
        {
            // Name
            // Author
            // Genre
            // Year Published
            // is it fiction?
        };

        // now comes the cool part!
        // we can output any value above into the console by calling the object then . then the variable on that object
        // That might look something like this... 
        // console.log(book_1.name);

        // The way i like to think of this is kinda like how files are stored.
        // you have "c:" then "/users" then "/public".. that gets you to your public folder inside users on your c drive
        // Just like you follow the folders you can follow the . notation
        // if you are trying to call name from an object you need to first tell its base location / what object specifically
        // then reference the variable INSIDE that object
